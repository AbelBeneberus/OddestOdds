## Architectural Considerations

1. **Performance and Data Retrieval**: All read operations are conducted directly from Redis cache, aiming to provide rapid data retrieval for an optimal user experience. This design choice prioritizes performance and responsiveness.

2. **Cache Health**: The system assumes that the Redis cache is always in a healthy state, with data integrity maintained. It's crucial to monitor and maintain cache health to ensure data accuracy and system reliability.

3. **Real-time Updates**: SignalR is employed for real-time updates, enabling instantaneous push of changes to the `PunterApp`.

4. **Odds Representation and Data Structure**: The solution is tailored for the 1x2 betting model. Market Selections are structured with the Home, Draw, and Away sides, represented using enums for clarity and consistency.

5. **Odds Encapsulation**: Odds are encapsulated within the Market Selection domain, ensuring a clear boundary and separation from other components.

6. **Participants Domain**: Participants, such as football teams, are managed within the Fixture domain, providing a structured approach to handle various participants.

7. **Fixture Bootstrapping**: A dedicated `Fixture` controller facilitates easy bootstrapping and creation of Fixtures and Markets, simplifying the initialization process.

## Business Assumptions

1. **1x2 Betting Model**: The primary focus is on the 1x2 betting model, which includes:

   - `1` for a Home win.
   - `x` for a Draw.
   - `2` for an Away win.

2. **Cache Maintenance Job**: As a future enhancement, integrating a job (e.g., using Hangfire) to periodically refresh and maintain cache health would be beneficial. This job would ensure data accuracy, system reliability, and would address potential discrepancies between the primary data store and the cache.
